CyberPyon (Project in development)

CyberPyon is a discord bot that will allow members of the server to "become Pokemon trainers" and catch random Pokemon represented with their cards.

This project is developed in Node.js, Discord.js, and MySQL, also using the Pokemon TCG API.

Users registered as a pokemon trainer are stored in the MySQL database.To become Pokemon Trainers, users must use the !trainer command.

The project code allows you to change the prefix of the commands in the config.json file. 
The commands are located in the commands folder and you can modify them.
To change the name of the commands, it is recommended to change both the file name and its name property.

For now, this is the initial goal. The project is under development, and when all functions are complete a more detailed README file will be created.
